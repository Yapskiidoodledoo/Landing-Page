            <blockquote>
            
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I start this, would first like to introduce my name.<sup>1</sup> My name is Jericho Matthew B. Yap.<sup>2</sup> I was born and raised in <b>Quezon City</b> my whole life even till this day.<sup>3</sup> We are a family of 6.<sup>4</sup> The names of my parents are <strong>Joey</strong> and <strong>Victoria</strong>.<sup>5</sup> For my siblings, we are brothers of 4 with me being the youngest.<sup>6</sup> Starting from the oldest we have Paul, John Victor, John Carl and me.<sup>7</sup> We are supposed to be 5 but <i>unfortunately</i>, my little sister had passed away.<sup>8</sup> A Little fact about me, Me, my Father, and my Sister have the same birthday which is in the 27<sup>th</sup> of September.<sup>9</sup><br><br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best thing that I would say that happened in my childhood years is that when I was always outside playing with my friends’ morning till night.<sup>10</sup> I also like the years where I would spend my time together with my cousins and would go shopping with them with our parents.<sup>11</sup> The <strong><i>most memorable</i></strong> one is when us while family, including our cousins, would go to the beach and would camp for 2 to 3 days.<sup>12</sup> They let us cousins have a bond with each other.<sup>13</sup> <br><br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my educational background, I really don’t remember much.<sup>14</sup> I don’t even remember the name of my school during kindergarden because for what I remember it was just like a small house and that is where we would <s>study</s> learn.<sup>15</sup> And if I remember correctly, <em>it was around Banawe St. near Manila.</em><sup>15</sup> After that we moved out to <b>Quezon City</b> <em>because that is nearer the offices of my parents</em>.<sup>17</sup> I was quite sad at that time because I have made many friends at my old house but nonetheless it happened.<sup>18</sup><br><br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hobbies during this time are just playing outside and not really thinking of tech at the time because I remember that during this time, I don’t really have anything in mind on what I want to be in the future.<sup>19</sup> My biggest hobby that I would say this time is I guess playing basketball because it is our <strong>father</strong> who <i>influenced</i> us to play this sport.<sup>20</sup> I really don’t hate it; I even loved the sport to the point that I joined our varsity team in elementary at <strong>St. Patrick School of QC.</strong><sup>21</sup>

            <blockquote>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My teenage years has been a ride for me.<sup>1</sup> It has a lot of ups and downs but I manage to push through.<sup>2</sup> This is also the time where <i>I fell in love in tech</i>, especially in phones.<sup>3</sup> This was also the time that I was first exposed in <kbd>HTML</kbd> so there’s that but it was only the basics.<sup>4</sup> I <strong>don’t</strong> think I manage to excel in it and stop midway.<sup>5</sup><br><br> 

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best thing that I would say that happened to me during my teenage years is that, <em>I was able to make new friends.</em><sup>5</sup> <strong>Not just that but friends that I still have connection with till now</strong>.<sup>6</sup> I enjoy hanging out with them even during those times.<sup>7</sup> We would always go out after school.<sup>8</sup> Since this is also the year that the <s>Covid-19</s> pandemic happened.<sup>9</sup> This is the time when I was addicted to <strong>pc games.</strong><sup>10</sup> I would only play games and not listen to the lecture but I still get pretty good grades because of my friends who lend me their notes.<sup>11</sup> <br><br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My educational background this time is still at <strong>St. Patrick</strong> and that is where I graduate.<sup>12</sup> <em>I have taken STEM strand in Senior Highschool because this time I have dreamt of becoming an <strong>Electrical Engineer.</strong></em><sup>13</sup> I want to be an <strong> Electrical Engineer</strong> at that time because when I was in grade 7, <em>I was exposed to the world of electronics.</em><sup>14</sup> I find it quite fun and would make little projects at home, like a simple switch using a breadboard and such.<sup>15</sup><br><br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hobbies during these years have also changed, it became playing an instrument, namely the guitar.<sup>16</sup> Doing this I was also able to participate in the Battle of the Bands at our school event making it a highlight to my high school days.<sup>17</sup> I have also played basketball.<sup>18</sup> But it became less because I found another sport that I quite like and that is volleyball.<sup>19</sup> Although I did not play in any competitions, me and my friends still played during class and after school.<sup>20</sup><br><br>

            <blockquote>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year is the present, The college years.<sup>1</sup> My journey started in the year 2022, at first, I was scared of course because we needed to start college in an online setting.<sup>2</sup> I was also scared because at this time I do not know what I really want to take.<sup>3</sup> My course <b>BSIT</b> is just an impulse course because I was not able to get in to the college that I really wan.<sup>4</sup> But non the less here I am and I quite actually like being an IT student.<sup>5</sup> <br><br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not made that many memories this college years because I feel like that, college just started.<sup>1</sup> But it does not mean I didn’t make any.<sup>6</sup> My favorite memory is when we go to <em><b>UAAP basketball and cheerleading competition.</b></em><sup>7</sup> It was quite a scene.<sup>8</sup> Different colleges have come together to support their own university but for me, I was happy because I was with my friends.<sup>9</sup> <br><br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hobbies this time have not changed but rather it increased.<sup>10</sup> One of them is cycling.<sup>11</sup> I was inspired by a youtuber that I have watched and I manage to save enough money so that I can buy my own bike.<sup>12</sup> With me and my friend we were able to go many places that we thought that we can’t because it’s quite far from us.<sup>13</sup> We planned to go to different close provinces like <b>Bulacan, Pampanga and other provinces around NCR</b> but due to our schedule getting mixed up we weren’t able to.<sup>14</sup><br><br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not be putting my educational background because now I study at University of the East.<sup>15</sup> But what I can add is the school that I wanted to go but was rejected.<sup>16</sup> The college that I wanted at first is TUP.<sup>17</sup> <b><em>TUP</em></b> because <em>firstly,</em> it is a state university meaning that it is free.<sup>18</sup> <em>Second</em>, is that it’s Electrical Engineering is one of the top of topnotches.<sup>19</sup> And <em>lastly</em>, I wanted to go here because I wanted to help my parents in terms of financial.<sup>20</sup> And that is all that I have to share.<sup>21</sup> Of course in the future I can update it and I hope that all that I will add would be a positive addition.<sup>22</sup>
