        <h2>Skills:</h2>
        <blockquote>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing a skill starts from it being a curiosity to oneself.<sup>1</sup> There are different kinds of skill, and I to have develop many skills that helped me through out the years.<sup>2</sup> Be it in childhood, teenage years, and even this college I still manage to retain those said skills although some of them may have not.<sup>3</sup> So here are some of the skills that I have garnered and how was I able to learn it.<sup>4</sup> <br><br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First is my basketball skill.<sup>5</sup> It is mediocre at best but I was able to learn this skill through the help of my father who have taught me how to play as I mentions in the page about me.<sup>6</sup> Other skills that I have develop in sports is the game volleyball.<sup>7</sup> This sport in particular is the sport that I only play because of the influence of my friends.<sup>8</sup> The last is the sport softball.<sup>9</sup> Softball because during my High School days we had a subject about this sport and also during this time I was influenced, not by my friends but because of the show that I have watched.<sup>10</sup> <br><br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now for the skills that I have developed that is not related to sports is my skill in designing.<sup>11</sup> As I joined in an organization this year, my skills in doing designs have significantly improved because of all the activities and programs that we have to make.<sup>12</sup> My skill in programming have also improved during the summer.<sup>13</sup> I have tried different exercises that I can find in the web just to further refine my works in terms or programming.<sup>14</sup> Although there are many more skills that I have failed to mention like my skill in cooking, playing an instrument, repairing things, and so much more.<sup>15</sup> I feel that what I have mentioned are things that can make the reader understand me even more.<sup>16</sup>

        <h2>Hobbies:</h2>
        <blockquote>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of time, I have found myself thinking on what I want to do during the day.<sup>1</sup> At first it can be fun because you can have something to lookup for if you ever been bored.<sup>2</sup> But as the day progress you can find yourself more and more unfulfilled because of how repetitive it can be.<sup>3</sup> So, for me finding a hobby that I can do is an essential thing to do to not make my day like its being mundane.<sup>4</sup> <br><br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I first look on a hobby through the internet.<sup>5</sup> I find what’s has been trending or what interests me that day.<sup>6</sup> Somedays it just pops into my mind on what I need to do that day.<sup>7</sup> Example is when I find a new recipe in the internet and I find it delicious because one of my hobbies is cooking.<sup>8</sup> My other hobby is playing an instrument.<sup>9</sup> When I feel like I want some peace around our home or just something pleasant to the ears.<sup>10</sup> I would play my guitar and just play it for hours and hours through out the day.<sup>11</sup> Next hobby is going outdoors, especially biking.<sup>11</sup> I have liked biking for almost 3 years now because it is my kind of way to unwind, the same goes for guitar.<sup>12</sup> Biking for me is refreshing to the feeling but unfortunately, I hardly ever unwind now using my bike because of how unorganized our bike lanes are in this country.<sup>13</sup> I am also fond of playing games especially online because I would be able to play with my friends even at home.<sup>14</sup> <br><br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can develop many kinds of hobbies depending on the year or the month.<sup>15</sup> Depending on the month because it may be a cold weather or vice versa.<sup>16</sup> It also depends on the month because for what I have observed to myself I tend to develop hobbies when I am in a vacation.<sup>17</sup> Maybe because for me being in a vacation month can be repetitive and I need to find something new fast.<sup>18</sup>

        <h2>Interests:</h2>
        <blockquote>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of my hobbies and skills have all first become an interest of mine.<sup>1</sup> Because I probably would not touch that kind of hobbies or skills if it did not even cross my mind.<sup>2</sup> But because of this interest I have developed different skills and hobbies that I know I can be proud of.<sup>3</sup> Until now I have many interests that I want to explore in the future.<sup>4</sup> It may be due to money or time that I am not be able do achieve this but I still put it in my imaginary list of the things that I want to do in the future.<sup>5</sup> <br><br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my interests that have wanted to do for the longest time is to drive.<sup>6</sup> I have a license but this is only for motorcycles and not for cars.<sup>7</sup> This is one of my interests because what I want in the future is to travel long distances be it in solo style or an outing with friends far away from cities.<sup>8</sup> Another interest is my interest in learning other languages in programming.<sup>9</sup> It may sound unrealistic but I really want to learn all of programming languages including binary coding.<sup>10</sup> I want to even broaden my skills because I know it will greatly help my future.<sup>11</sup> Learning different languages in general (not in programming) is also one of my interests growing up.<sup>12</sup> As I want to travel the world, I do not want to rely more on my devices just to navigate to the place I would want to go but what I would want is to communicate with different people from different countries.<sup>13</sup> <br> <br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that I am only living my Second year in college but I hope that in the future I can achieve this kind of things in life.<sup>1</sup> To travel the world, to have a road-trip, and to be able to improve myself.<sup>14</sup> I also know that me being in my second year is a lot more interest would pop up in my head as I grow up and me even more mature as I am now.<sup>15</sup> And I hope that all of the things that I can think of is would be achieved by my own hard work.<sup>16</sup> And as the saying goes “It's hard work that makes things happen." —Shonda Rhimes.<sup>17</sup>
